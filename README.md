Whether you want to lose a couple of pounds - not that you need it, just to show that you can if you want to - or if you want to always be prepared to answer the question "What did you eat for lunch three full moons ago?", Fed is the right tool for you. There's no knowing yourself without knowing your body, and you are what you eat!

"I never knew there was a thing more useful than a plumbus" - Jeff  
"That's nice, honey" - Grandma  
"Could you please repeat that?" - Drive-in person  

Key features:
* diary management - add and remove meals at any time on the timeline of your current universe
* offline food database - for those evenings when you're dining in a cave in the middle of the ocean and don't have wifi
* no ads or subscriptions
